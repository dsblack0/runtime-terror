# Contributing

## Commit Policies
1. Multiple people should not be adding code to the same file at the same time. 
2. Make sure that you have first pulled and merged before making a commit.
3. Do not commit files that you don't remember changing or files with broken code.
4. If you do need to commit code with some problems, save it to a separate branch instead of the master.
5. Each main feature should be worked on through a separate branch designated for that feature. All commits regarding that feature should be made only to that branch.
   * When that feature is completely working, you must create a pull request that will be reviewed before merging the branch with the master
