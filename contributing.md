# Contributing

## Commit Policy
1. Multiple people should not be adding code to or working on the same file at the same time.
2. Do not change the formatting of (reorganize) any existing folders or files without prior discussion
3. Make sure that you have first pulled and merged before making a commit.
4. Do not commit files that you don't remember changing or files with broken code.
5. Make sure to resolve any conflicts when you pull or push
6. If you do need to commit code with some problems, save it to a separate branch instead of the master.
7. Each main feature should be worked on through a separate branch designated for that feature. All commits regarding that feature should be made only to that branch.
   * When that feature is completely working, you must create a pull request that will be reviewed before merging the branch with the master

## Creating Branches
**Make a new branch whenever you start working on a new feature**
1. On IntelliJ go to **Git** > **New Branches...**
2. Set a descriptive name for the branch
3. Check the option for **Checkout Branch** to switch to that branch
4.
